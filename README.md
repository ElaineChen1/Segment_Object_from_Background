# Segment_Object_from_Background

- Extract objects from background using Thresholding Techniques.
    - Place object in a homogenous background.

## Observations
- Overall: **The Adaptive Thresholding using both mean and gaussian had the best results.**
- *Simple Thresholding* - Object was extracted but there was still some noise in the bottom left.
- *Adaptive Thresholding* - Object was extracted from the background.
- *Gaussian Thresholding* - Object was extracted from the background.
- *Otsu Thresholding* - Half of the object was not identified.
- *Riddler-Calvard Thresholding* - More than half of the object were not identified.
